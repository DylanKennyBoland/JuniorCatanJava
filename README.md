This project is concerned with creating or emulating the junior version of the Catan board game - the brave can take on the task
of mimicking the adult version! As for the rules, they can be found online, and they also come with the game itself.
The project is being done through Java, and the integrated-development environment (IDE) that'll be used is Eclipse.
